<p>The difference between this and SingleSpringApp is that this uses the experimental
layout called TabLayout3.</p>

<p>TabLayout3 is similar to TabLayout, except each canvas has its own controls area.
Each pair of canvas and controls are contained in a div. This makes it visually clear
which controls go with the SimView, and which go with the Graph (or TimeGraph). The
controls are shown or hidden along with the canvas in most layouts.
