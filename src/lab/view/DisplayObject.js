/** An object that can be displayed in a {@link myphysicslab.lab.view.LabView}, often it
is the visible representation of a {@link SimObject}.

Each DisplayObject has a default policy about when the SimObject it represents is
dragable; this can be overridden via the {@link #setDragable} method.

Many DisplayObjects allow specifying a **prototype** DisplayObject. When a display
property is `undefined`, then the property is fetched from the prototype. If it is also
`undefined` on the prototype then a default value is used.

See the View section of [myPhysicsLab Architecture](Architecture.html#view) for more
about how DisplayObjects are used within an application.

  Examples are DisplayClock, EnergyBarGraph.

  be set.  Examples are DisplayConnector, DisplayRope, DisplaySpring.
