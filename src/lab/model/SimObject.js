/** Represents an object in a Simulation. The purpose of a SimObject is two-fold:

1. To give the outside world a view of what is going on in the Simulation.

2. A SimObject might be used in a Simulation's internal calculations.

A set of SimObjects are stored in a {@link myphysicslab.lab.model.SimList SimList}. The
SimObjects represent the current state of the Simulation.

For an {@link myphysicslab.lab.model.ODESim ODESim} the current state is dictated by
the variables in its {@link myphysicslab.lab.model.VarsList VarsList} and the
SimObjects reflect that state in their positions and velocities.

A SimObject can give additional information that is not in the VarsList, such as size,
shape, and mass of objects. A SimObject can represent forces or anchor objects which
are not available in the VarsList.

SimObjects are updated to reflect the current state when the
{@link myphysicslab.lab.model.Simulation#modifyObjects} method is called.

See {@link myphysicslab.lab.view.DisplayObject} for a discussion of how SimObjects are
made visible to the user.

A SimObject has an *expiration time* so that we can add temporary objects,
representing things like forces or collision impact, and set the time at which they
should be removed from the simulation display.  Permanent SimObjects have infinite
expiration time. See {@link #getExpireTime}.
