/** Processes mouse events to either (1) directly move a {@link DisplayObject} or (2)
forward events to an {@link EventHandler}.

(1) MouseTracker moves the DisplayObject directly when:

+ No EventHandler is specified.

+ `dragDispObj` does not have a SimObject. Examples include DisplayClock and
EnergyBarGraph.

+ `dragDispObj` has a SimObject but it is not recognized by the EventHandler.
An EventHandler indicates that it doesn't recognize a SimObject by returning `false`
from {@link EventHandler#startDrag}. An example scenario is a dragable marker
object which the user can position as desired.

(2) Events are sent to the EventHandler when:

+ `dragDispObj` has a SimObject which is recognized by the EventHandler. An
EventHandler indicates that it recognizes a SimObject by returning `true` from
{@link EventHandler#startDrag}. In this case, events are translated to simulation
coordinates for the LabView that the DisplayObject is in.

+ `dragDispObj` is `null`. In this case, events are translated to simulation
coordinates of the specified LabView.

See *Mouse Events* in {@link myphysicslab.lab.app.SimController}.

@todo  what to do when there are multiple SimObjects, as with DisplayPath?

@todo  Make a unit test; especially for findNearestDragable.  Note that it is
    possible to make synthetic events for testing in Javascript.

/*  Design Notes

It is possible to have a DisplayObject that has a SimObject, but which is used
for display only. This is similar to the 'DisplayObject without SimObject' case like
EnergyBarGraph or DisplayClock, except that someone (the app, or the user via Terminal)
has made a SimObject that the Simulation is unaware of.

The use case is for teaching or experimenting: you might add some static but moveable
DisplayObjects to a LabView for marking the starting or ending position of an object
(for example to show the effect of different parameter values or initial conditions).

Imagine adding text, lines, shapes, etc., by writing short scripts in Terminal. One
could make a fancier user interface like a tool bar for adding and deleting shapes. You
might indicate selection by showing with handles for resizing. This is all beyond the
scope of the MouseTracker class, but is a possible future direction. The current
MouseTracker should however be able to move such DisplayObjects if they exist.

simulation coordinates of the LabCanvas's

Searches all the LabView's of the LabCanvas, in front to back order. When a
