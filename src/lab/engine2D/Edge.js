/** An Edge of a Polygon has a start and finish Vertex and belongs to a particular
Polygon. Vertex location is defined in body coordinates of the associated Polygon. An
Edge knows which side is outside or inside the Polygon; the method
{@link #getNormalBody} returns a normal vector that points to the outside.

Edges are ordered in a Polygon, see {@link Polygon}. For a
given Edge, the start Vertex must be the same as the finish Vertex of the previous Edge
of the Polygon.

## Terminology

<img src="Edge_Normal_Vector.svg">

A **normal vector** is a perpendicular to an Edge, see
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)>.

A **unit normal** is a normal vector with length 1. Here 'normal vector' usually also
implies that it is a unit normal vector.
