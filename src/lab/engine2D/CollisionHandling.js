### SIMULTANEOUS

All collisions are solved in a single step, with the goal condition being that the
post-collision velocity is equal to elasticity times opposite of pre-collision velocity.

### HYBRID

Like SERIAL, this operates on one collision at a time, but for each collision it will
include any other collisions on either of the two bodies involved (for finite mass
bodies only), doing a simultaneous collision handling for that set of bodies. Any bodies
connected by joints are also included.

### SERIAL (4 flavors)

Operates on one 'focus' collision at a time, applying the impulse and then dealing with
any 'ricochet' effects as objects thereby collide into other objects. This happens
repeatedly in a tight loop (within the collision handling method) until all ricochets
die out and no objects are colliding. The focus collision is chosen randomly each time
thru the loop. This tends to produce the most realistic results.

There are four flavors of the SERIAL option, described below.

### SEPARATE vs. GROUPED

SERIAL_GROUPED treats **joints** connected to the focus collision together with the
focus collision (essentially a simultaneous collision handling for the group of current
collision + connected joints). SERIAL_SEPARATE allows us to see *how joints would
ricochet back and forth* because they are handled separately like any other collision.

The SERIAL_GROUPED option turns out to give the same results as SERIAL_SEPARATE and is
much faster. But SERIAL_SEPARATE lets us see that these two are equivalent by trying
each option (and especially by turning on the appropriate debug statements inside
handleCollisionsSerial).

### LASTPASS

The SERIAL_SEPARATE_LASTPASS and SERIAL_GROUPED_LASTPASS options turn on the *final
pass* in `handleCollisionsSerial` which does a *single simultaneous collision handling*
with zero elasticity to all remaining collisions.

The serial collision handling loop in `ImpulseSim.handleCollisionsSerial()` ends when
all the collisions have either been handled (and therefore have large positive velocity)
or have velocity is close to zero. The *last pass* ensures that the collisions with very
small negative velocity get a final small impulse so they are left with zero velocity.
This helps reduce 'jitter' at places that should have zero velocity like contact points
or joints.

* ***WARNING*** the zero elasticity used during LASTPASS results in a small amount of
  energy loss.

* Note that enum types do not appear correctly in the documentation, they appear
* as the underlying type (string, number, boolean) instead of the enum type.
* see [Dossier issue #32](https://github.com/jleyba/js-dossier/issues/32).
