<p>StuckTestApp runs a simulation that is guaranteed to become "stuck", at which
point we should get an error dialog and be able to restart the simulation. This is
mainly a check that the error handling mechanism is working properly.
</p>

<p>The simulation being run is ImpulseSim rather than the usual ContactSim. The
scenario is `CircleStraightTest.ball_falls_on_floor_setup` in which a ball bounces
on the floor, each bounce is less high and eventually the simulation becomes stuck
because of the lack of contact forces.
